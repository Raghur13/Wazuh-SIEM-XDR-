Installing and setting up Wazuh SIEM &amp; XDR to anlayse security events and logs and responding to threats

Wazuh seems like this open-source platform for security stuff, you know, it handles SIEM and XDR to keep an eye on threats. It watches over systems and endpoints, trying to spot anything weird and respond fast.
I think the main thing is how it pulls in logs from servers and all those endpoints, then goes through them to find suspicious activity. After that, it shows alerts on a dashboard thats centralized, which makes it easier to see everything in one place.
For features, it covers log management and intrusion detection, plus file integrity monitoring. It also does vulnerability detection, and endpoint security works for Windows or Linux. That part feels pretty useful.In security operations, people use it a lot for detecting threats, checking compliance, and analyzing incidents. Its not just one thing, it ties into a bunch of areas.
And yeah, its fully open-source, so you can deploy it on-premises or in the cloud, or even hybrid setups.
